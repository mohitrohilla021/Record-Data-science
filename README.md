# User-Record-Data-science

The User Record page is organized into sections.

The General Information fields are available at the top of the user record, which include basic information about the user, such as name, photograph, and user name.

This simple project keeps the record of the users that are currently logged in the server. Given the list of the data it is capable of predicting the names of the users that are currently actively using the server.
